      <description>About Effective Altruism Belgium Effective Altruism Belgium is a Belgian non-profit organization and the umbrella organization of all Belgian effective altruism groups. Effective altruism is a philosophy and social movement that applies evidence and reason to determine the most effective ways to improve the world. Effective altruists aim to consider all causes and actions, and then act in the way that brings about the greatest positive impact. It is this broad evidence-based approach that distinguishes effective altruism from traditional altruism or charity.</description>
